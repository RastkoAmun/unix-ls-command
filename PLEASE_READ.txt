My code is not complete.
When you compile it will work only for current working direcotry, that is you can't specify path in a argument
When calling call ./UnixLs

My implementation for ls -l and ls -i is working.
Also the combination of the two, ls -il or ls -li.
However my -R is not working, but I had some code for it in a function called command_R()
- I tried to do it, but it doesn't work properly, can you take a look and maybe I can get some partial marks for it
